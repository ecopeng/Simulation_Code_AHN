1. `Model_Test_BestFittingParameters.R`: the R script for the simulations to test the performance of the AHN model (by generating animal habitat networks using the 'best' sets of parameters identified from the given parameter space and empirical networks, and evaluating how much the structural properties of simulated networks deviated from those of empirical ones)

2. `Friesen_et_al.rdata`: the empirical networks used, which are available from [Friesen et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1890)

3. `Transmission_on_AHNs.R`: the R script for simulating pathogen transmissions on animal habitat networks

4. `Model_Test.R`: the R script for simulating animal habitat networks with the given parameter space and finding those most approximate ones to the empirical networks (results are not included in the manuscript)
